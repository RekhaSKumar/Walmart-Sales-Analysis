Overview

This project includes two main components:

A Python script (project.py): Developed and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), focusing on data analysis, visualization, and processing tasks.

A SQL Script (PSQL Queries.sql): Contains PostgreSQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and management.

File Descriptions

1. Python Code (project.py)

Performs comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
